##### We'll start with a few different interest rates ########

rate_character <- '8%'

rate_double <- 0.08

rate_integer <- 8L

rate_numeric <- 08

#### Write a function, format_rate that uses an if statement to return the correct double value for the rates above #####
### HINT: it will be helpful for you to search for the R function that will find and replace values in strings. #####


#### Run the format rate function on each of the interest rates and store the variable with an _f on the end to denote 
#### that it was formated. e.g. rate_character_f
