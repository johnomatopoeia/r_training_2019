# create a vector_n containing the numbers 50 to 100



# create a vector_c containing apples, bananas, and carrots



# create a vector_l containing the logical values true, false, true, true, false, true, false, false



# add 25 to each value in vector_n, storing the result as vector_n25



# create vector_n125 as the sum of vector_n and vector_n25



# slice the first item in vector_c and store it as item_1



# slice the last item in vector_n125 and store it as n125_last



# slice items 30 to 40 from vector_n and store it as vector_n3040



# concatenate vector_n with vector_n125 as vector_cn125



# combine vector_n and vector_n25 as two columns in matrix_c



# combine vector_n and vector_n25 as two rows in matrix_r



# create a list containing vector_n125, vector_c, and matrix_r



# create a matrix from the third item in list_1 and store it as matrix_l
